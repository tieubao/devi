## Notes

Plot twist: You should aware it's really hard to find the good name the common app. **DevÄ«** is the Sanskrit word for "goddess". In Hindu, Devi Lakshmi is known as goddess of wealth, fortune, and prosperity. Her four hands represent the four goals of human life considered important to the Hindu way of life.
